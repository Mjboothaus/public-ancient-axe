"No data in Excel" :)

Prototype (Streamlit) App to deconstruct / summarise etc Excel workbooks

Add button to upload Excel file (no-PII data please!) and then parse it for data - possibly push to SQLite / summary (data quality?) / charts(?) / insights.

Try building this Streamlit App as just a script (not Notebooks via `nbdev`) and compare workflows.
